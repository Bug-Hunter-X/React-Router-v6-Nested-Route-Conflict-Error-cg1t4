This repository demonstrates a common error in React Router v6 involving nested routes with conflicting path segments.  The bug showcases how overlapping route definitions lead to unexpected behavior and errors.  The solution provides a corrected approach using path parameters and more selective route matching to avoid the conflict.  The example uses functional components and the `useParams` hook but can be adapted to class components as needed.
